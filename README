SimpleEMR
=========

A simple but non-trivial hadoop application that reads data into mappers and does
nothing with the data.  Used primarily for training and performance testing.

	- depends on external jar file (included in ./lib)

TO USE:
=======

See included Makefile for various options.  The makefile can be used to create the
emr cluster of various sizes, to launch jobs and to build the software. 

% make 
  make create - create a new cluster (10 c1.mediums instances)
  make createlarge - create new cluster (10 cc1s)
  make createlargeopt - 10 cc1's with lots of mappers
  make createhuge - create new cluster (10 cc2's)
  make createhugeopt - 10 cc2's with lots of mappers
  make destroy - destroy cluster

  (note: you can only build one cluster at a time!)
 
  make runjob - submit SimpleEMR application into cluster
  make runjobopt - submit simpleEMR applicaiton with optimal input split size

make createhugeopt and make runjobopt give you the best performance.
compare with make create and runjob.

Don't forget to terminate the cluster:  % make destroy or % elastic-mapreduce --terminate -j <jobflow>

TO BUILD the java source:
========================

1. you will likely need to add the biopig-core jar to your local maven repository since it
is not available in any public repo.

   % mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./lib/biopig-core-0.3.0.jar -DgroupId=gov.jgi.gentech -DartifactId=biopig-core -Dversion=0.3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

2. now build the assembly (jar of jars):

   % mvn package

This builds into ./target/SimpleEMR-0.1.0-job.jar

This jar is an assembly, it includes all the dependencies as well as the application jar.  see
pom.xml for configuration details.
